## Week 3 Assignment

### Task
Bring one of your quantitative visualization ideas into the context of the Met Museum. How can it apply here? What data set is interesting to explore quantitatively? What story is interesting to tell?

The visualization idea I want to pursue is a heat map of Europe, showing the quantity of artwork outputs by country, every one hundred years. I think this idea suitable for the MET because of the vast timespan of their digital collection and (hopefully) tagged, geogrpahic locations of their pieces. The visualization would be wrangling a large data set, therefore communicating a powerful message of creative progression through the lifetime of Europe.
