## MET : Quantitative visualization
### Update

My concept last week was to create a heatmap of Europe pre and peak Renaissance era, comparing creative outputs from each country. Alec's feedback on my concept helped me realize that it would be difficult to compare artwork by country, especially if the boundaries had chnaged between time periods. Borders were always shifting back then, so, to escape the potential inconsistencies when using the API search, I thought I would switch my locational focus to an area with more structured geopolitical boundaries: the United States. My plan is to now create a heatmap of the United States from 1900-1949 and 1950-2000, also comparing creative outputs but from each state. There were so many changes happening in the US during that century, so I am curious to see if there are any county-wide or state to state differences in artwork being created. I have run through a limited amount of search paramenters in the API, becuase I am still having some trouble figuring out how to run various queries. Once I am able to secure my targeted dataset, my plan is to either build the visualization using javascript, p5, D3 or use arcGIS / illustrator. If I have an excel table with the desired information, I know I can filter it, create a shapefile, and add coordinates to each data point, and have that point represent the quantitative value of each state. If the heat map proves to be too much, I plan to create a map with circles over each state, with the relative area of the circles representing the numbers of artworks created from that state. These relative shape sizes will have to be consistent between the two, half-century comparisons. Please see below for work-in-progess images.
