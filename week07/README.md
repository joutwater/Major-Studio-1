# Rembrandt project

My goal since the last topic discussion was to research and develop data on Rembrandt and his portrait paintings. At first, I wanted to just look at portraits he had created, but it went much further once I found out more about Rembrandt. A couple interesting facts : He created at least 40 self-portraits thouhgout his career (up until death) and nearly half of what was thought to be his original work was attributed to his pupils. I am going to focus on Rembrandt's portrait paintings, both of others and himself. I have created a few visualizations (below) to help create a story around the various subjects of his portraits and timeline of his self portraits.

## Viz 1

I want to create a grid of Rembrandt's regular portraits first. There are between 50 and 60. Once arranged in a grid pattern, I want to add an interactivity to the photos so when the mouse hovers over an image, it displays symbols thats describe various qualitative information and highlight the current portrait's connections to others. I plan to use the image loading that we went through in last week's lab with p5. I need to do more research on the mouse over capabilities.

## Viz 2

My next visualization concept is to introduce the viewer to Rembrandt's self portraits. I want to loop through each of Rembrandt's forty self portraits to show how he grew older over time (from his perspective) and hopefully highlight any stylistic differences. I wonder if I should add a date or another visual variable to offer an addition understanding of progression in each image.
