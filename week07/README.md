# Qualitative Project : Rembrandt's Portraits

My goal since the last topic discussion was to research and develop data on Rembrandt and his portrait paintings. At first, I wanted to just look at portraits he had created, but it went much further once I found out more about Rembrandt. A couple interesting facts : He created at least 40 self-portraits thouhgout his career (up until death) and nearly half of what was thought to be his original work was attributed to his pupils. I am going to focus on Rembrandt's portrait paintings, both of others and himself. I have created a few visualizations (below) to help create a story around the various subjects of his portraits and timeline of his self portraits.

## Viz 1

I want to create a grid of Rembrandt's regular portraits first. There are between 50 and 60. Once arranged in a grid pattern, I want to add an interactivity to the photos so when the mouse hovers over an image, it displays symbols thats describe various qualitative information and highlight the current portrait's connections to others. I plan to use the image loading that we went through in last week's lab with p5. I need to do more research on the mouse over capabilities.

## Viz 2

My next visualization concept is to introduce the viewer to Rembrandt's self portraits. I want to loop through each of Rembrandt's forty self portraits to show how he grew older over time (from his perspective) and hopefully highlight any stylistic differences. I am thinking of using framecount in p5 and changing opactity to more seamlessly flow through each portrait. I wonder if I should add a date or another visual variable to offer an addition understanding of progression in each image.

## Viz 3

This visualization supplements the previous self-portrait example, offering a timeline showing the amount of self-portraits created in each year on top (images stacked) and then biographical life events below the timeline. It could be interesting to see how life events could have affected his self-portraits. Maybe this would be better to show both regular portriats and self-portraits so there would be more data points? This would be a static viz as of now.

## Viz 4

If possible, I want to use my background in photogrammetry to replicate a similar environment to rembrandt's portraits. If I can get a free trial of the program, I would take pictures around a subject at different heights, and process the photos to create a dense cloud showing 3D qualitites of a recreated studio. This would be a bit of a bonus but I think it would be cool to see a 3D space.

### Challenges

1. Data: The MET doesn't have all of Rembrandt's portraits or self-protraits (understandably), so it will take some time on the web to find and verify all images. This will be especially tough since it is still debated whether some of his work is actually his, but I will just have to try my best. Also, I will have to store and manage my imagery locallly first, and bring into AWS somehow for manipulation in p5. Aside from the images, I do need to spend time getting information on each image and figure out how each relates to another. I will have to create some sort of map for this.

2. Code: I haven't used a lot of the code that will be required for this project to work, but I think it is a doable challenge. I plan to follow the imagery lab last thursday and make slight edits to create my grid. I plan to learn about mouseover capabilities and apply them to the grid. I will use p5 for the imagery loop as well, since I have created animation following similar themes in a different class. I do want to spend some time in photoshop with each of the self-portraits to crop and edit the imagery so they flow well together.

3. Hosting on website: I have never done this but I think the project would be best displayed in this way. I have to learn how to make this happen.

4. Agisoft: Hopefully I can figure out a way to use the photogrammetry program agisoft to create the 3D model. I also hope I have time. I think it would be an amazing visualization though. It will be a last priority.
