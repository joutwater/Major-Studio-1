	<h1>Westward Expansion</h1>
	<h2>Origins of Creativity in the MET's American Collection
	</h2>
	<h4>The visualization below offers a geographical understanding of the MET's American collection by analyzing the amount of artworks coming from each state or territory between 1783 and 1945. Before beginning this journey, I must mention that although the MET's American collection is vast and highly varied in terms of cultural representation and medium, my study cannot speak for American art as a whole or offer a completely comprehensive understanding of creative proliferation in United States history. Please enjoy scrolling through the visualization below.</h4>

					<h3>1783-1802</h3>
					<p>At this time in American history, the borders of states have officially started to form after the British ceded their territories. Much of the future United States was still occupied by Native Americans and other foreign nations. Of the 913 artworks from this range, there were 613 of discernable origin.</p>

					<h3>1803-1844</h3>
					<p>The beginning of this date range marks a major event in expansion west - the Louisiana Purchase. Florida and other small territories were also ceded by Spain at this time. Of the 1618 artworks from this range, 1013 were of discernable origin</p>

				<div id="map3" class="step" data-step="3" data-scrollama-index="2" data-src="images/US_1845_1861.png">
					<h3>1845-1861</h3>
					<p>During this date range, Texas along with territories in the Midwest and Pacific Northwest were acquired as the geographical realization of America moved closer to its final boundaries. This date range ends at the beginning of the Civil War, marking a time of national divide in America. Of the 916 artworks attributed to this date range, 609 were of discernable origin</p>

					<h3>1862-1914</h3>
					<p>Through the Civil War and into the early 20th century, we see a substantial increase in western artistic activity as more territories have not only been acquired but settled. The range ends with the start of World War I, another era of turmoil in American history. Of the 3671 artworks in this time period, 2912 were of discernable origin</p>

				<div id="map5" class="step" data-step="5" data-scrollama-index="4" data-src="images/US_1915_1945.png">
					<h3>1915-1945</h3>
					<p>By now, the present day borders of the United States have taken shape and the intensity of movement west has subsided, revealing established focus points like California and Illinois. This range ends with the beginning of World War II, as another chapter of national unrest begins. Of the 849 artworks coming from this time, 690 were of discernable origin</p>
