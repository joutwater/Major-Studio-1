## Interactive Project : Westward Expansion

After my first attempt at conveying American Artistic output in the quantitative project, I couldn't help but use the third project's theme of interactivity to explore the concept further. Interactivity in data visualization has been an incredibly exciting realm so far, mostly because of the amazing narratives that can be told in this way. Coming into the American Art again, I wanted to take the time to thoughtfully define my date ranges of concern, look more deeply into the challenge of showing values with changing borders, and hopefully find interesting insights that could be interesting for us and our friends at the MET.

Technically, one of my goals in this project was to use d3, since I hadn’t used it in any previous projects. Also, I wasn’t expecting it at first, but I got to know html and css much better than I knew before.
