## Interactive Project : Westward Expansion

After my first attempt at conveying American Artistic output in the quantitative project, I couldn't help but use the third project's theme of interactivity to explore the concept further. Interactivity in data visualization has been an incredibly exciting realm so far, mostly because of the amazing narratives that can be told in this way. Coming into the American Art again, I wanted to take the time to thoughtfully define my date ranges of concern, look more deeply into the challenge of showing values with changing borders, and hopefully find interesting insights that could be interesting for us and our friends at the MET.

Technically, one of my goals in this project was to use d3, since I hadn’t used it in any previous projects. Also, I wasn’t expecting it at first, but I got to know html and css much better than I knew before. More than anything, this project taught me what it looks like when multiple programming language types work in harmony to create a data visualization of higher complexity and therefore more effective storytelling.

### Process: Technical

Starting out on this project, I wasn’t quite sure how I would be using d3, but I knew I wanted to include an interactive map of some kind. By doing research on bostocks bl.ocks and observable sites, I was able to learn about topojson / geojson formats, svgs, enter() update() exit(), and d3 syntax relating to maps. Through the research, I found a few helpful examples of US chloropleth maps with tooltip interactivity and, after reading through the code, editing, and adapting some of my own data and color schemes, I was able to move towards a map revealing artwork totals throughout the US. However, the one aspect I was missing was an interaction involving an image display tooltip. I tried to incorporate images in multiple ways throughout my project, but I was having difficulty with it either because it wasn’t flowing well with the rest of the narrative or I wasn’t able to figure out how to add it to my scrolly-telling maps appropriately. I finally figured out that the best way for me to add the imagery was through the d3 map. This took a lot of time but I finally figured it out! I was trying to add the image tooltip to the same svg as the map until I realized it was better to add the image to a new div in the body. It was interesting to learn about the .on mouse over, mouse move, mouse out, the various .attr options, and other syntax surrounding it.

To offer a final reflection on the interactive map and the image tooltip, I wish I could have actually included the image tooltip on the scrolly maps because I think it would have worked the best with my story. Secondly, there were a couple ways my code could have been more clean. The fill colors could have been organized with scaleOrdinal but I didn’t get around to working it out. Another issue was that I wasn’t able to create an image tooltip for every state in the d3 map. I could only get about 42 because some of the ids in the .tsv had a zero in front of it (01), which didn’t allow the corresponding images to work.

Another major component of my visualization was the implementation of scrollytelling. While I was figuring out the best sequence to show each map,
