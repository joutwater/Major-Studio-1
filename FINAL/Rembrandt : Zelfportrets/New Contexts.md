## New Contexts Project

### Early Stages

When presented with the prompt for our fourth and final project, I was determined to make something in three dimensions. I started looking into some options with photogrammetry and other modeling technologies, but with the limited timeframe, I decided to make something with my hands, leaving the computer screen. I would create a sculpture reflecting the data from my qualitative project of Rembrandt's self-portraits.

I immediately began looking for a generic 3d model online that I could manipulate for printing in the making center. Since I didn't have time to model each self-portrait, I decided to create an abstraction of each as represented by a generic human figure. As I began to print these I thought of the best way to showcase the figures. I had an idea of floating shelves in an array similar to my qualitative project. With some advice from Alec and Richard, I started to compose this piece after some time spent making mock ups.

### Reflections:

Technical: The most technical parts of this project were 3d printing and assembling the floating shelves in an even grid. I had never 3d printed before so figuring out the correct file formats and various steps and software processes that lead to a final printed figure. And then I had to do it for 40 figrues! Then, building a perfect grid for the shelves. Unfortunately the gentleman at ace hardware who cut my plywood cut it a bit shorter than 4 inches, so I couldn't space my shelves as easily as I imagined. I had to measure and mark the centerline of each shelf and have that correspond to a grid based of 8 center lines per column and repeat for 5 rows. It probably took about 3 hours to measure everything to be as I wanted. I then used epoxy to adhere each shelf to the backboard. Then I painted the shelves and backboard by hand with black acrylic paint.

Design: I wish I had more time to develop a visual language that bettter reflected Rembrandt's work, but I was still very happy with my finished project. I wanted the sculpture to have artistic integrity, whether or not a viewer knew about the data associated. As I mentioned, each figure was an abstraction of a self portrait. I used color, orientation and position to differentiate between different categories. The designs I was most proud of was painting each figure by hand (to give them an impressionist feel) and creating the visual effect of the figures rotating through Rembrandt's career. Some of the other visual language components worked but were not as special to me, as I did not have enough time to develop them further.
