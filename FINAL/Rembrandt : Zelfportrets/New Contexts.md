## New Contexts Project

### Early Stages

When presented with the prompt for our fourth and final project, I was determined to make something in three dimensions. I started looking into some options with photogrammetry and other modeling technologies, but with the limited timeframe, I decided to make something with my hands, leaving the computer screen. I would create a sculpture reflecting the data from my qualitative project of Rembrandt's self-portraits.

I immediately began looking for a generic 3d model online that I could manipulate for printing in the making center. Since I didn't have time to model each self-portrait, I decided to create an abstraction of each as represented by a generic human figure. As I began to print these I thought of the best way to showcase the figures. I had an idea of floating shelves in an array similar to my qualitative project. With some advice from Alec and Richard, I started to compose this piece after some time spent making mock ups.
