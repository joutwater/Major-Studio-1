## New Contexts Project

### Early Stages

When presented with the prompt for our fourth and final project, I was determined to make something in three dimensions. I started looking into some options with photogrammetry and other modeling technologies, but with the limited timeframe, I decided to make something with my hands, leaving the computer screen. I would create a sculpture reflecting the data from my qualitative project of Rembrandt's self-portraits.
