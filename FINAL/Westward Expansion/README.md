### Quantitative

This aspect of Westward expansion was a lot of data gathering and testing of different visuals. I created a new dataset based on the MET's geographic data, looking at the amount of artwork coming from each state over time. Much of the MET's data was empty in this category, so I had to research and make educated guesses about which state each artwork was from. This took a lot of my time in the first project, so I was only able to create a mock up of where I wanted to go. Thankfully, I had time to pursue this project further in my interactive project, and create a high fidelity visualization. Please see some of mock ups from the quantitative project below:
